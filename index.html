<h3>Meet GAVIN</h3>
<p>Gavin was born to parents George Washington and Denzel Washington in 1836, the year of the Dragon. 
    He was raised with dignity and compassion, taught to appreciate the finer things in life like the wind and also Hot dogs.
     At the ripe age of 187 he decided to attend Berklee College of Music despite having no musical knowledge, with the hope that he’d “just figure it out.” 
    There he met Roy and they bonded over their shared love of doorknobs. They started writing music together, but ran into a small issue. 
    \The music was too good (also GR is a terrible band name). When he met Will standing behind a telephone pole, he knew they had found that terrible factor they were missing.
</p>
    <h3>Meet ROY</h3>
    <p>“Wow, what a doorknob that is,” Roy thought as he stared at the door of the hospital room he was born in. 
        Roy was entranced by it. Enamored, even. From that moment on, he had one passion in life: Making music.
         He spent his childhood opening doors that were closed, overcoming hardships to reach Berklee. When he finally was accepted on his principal instrument of Slide Whistle, he was ecstatic. There were so many doors at this school! What’s more, most - if not all of them - had doorknobs. He dashed around campus, opening every door he could find. 
        Finally, he opened the door that would change his life.
         Standing behind the door eating a Hot dog was Gavin, his new best friend.
         They created a band with a really stupid name, GR, and got to work. 
        One day, Roy was introduced to Gavin’s new friend Will. Roy didn’t like Will because he was Strange, but I guess it’s okay I guess. </p>

    <h3>Meet WILL</h3>
      <p>At 1:50pm on February 18th, 2005, 
        Will Leitner crawled out of the Hudson River onto the shores of Irvington, New York. 
        The local townsfolk ran in terror.
         Leitner roamed the town wearing the three-piece suit he spawned in, searching for a purpose.
         He wandered for hours, days, weeks, years on end. Finally he stopped in the center of Times Square, Manhattan, 
        New York City, New York, USA, North America, Earth.
         He heard a beautiful noise, a noise that grabbed his inspiration by the throat and wouldn’t let go.
         That noise was: annoying. From this moment, Will knew that his life’s purpose was to be annoying. 
        He met Roy and Gavin the next day, and founded WGR on this principle.
